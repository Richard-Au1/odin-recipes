    <p>Here is a guide on how to make Japanese Egg Sando. It is more tart than other egg sandwiches because of the type
        of mayonnaise that is used. It consist of egg yolk rather than egg whites inside the mayonnaise.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>1/2 cup Mayonnaise</ul>
    <ul>1/4 teaspoon White sugar</ul>
    <ul>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</ul>
    <ul>3 dashes hot sauce or to taste</ul>
    <ul>1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</ul>
    <ul>2 teaspoons rice vinegar</ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>1. Place eggs in the bottom of a saucepan. Add 1/4 inch of water. Heat over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Cover and steam for 11 minutes. Turn off the heat and drain water carefully; pour cold water over and let cool.</ol> 
    <ol>2. Mix mayonnaise, salt, sugar, mustard, hot sauce, lemon juice, and vinegar for Kewpie-style mayonnaise together. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed.</ol>
    <ol>3. Peel eggs. Mash in a shallow bowl with the side and back of a fork until desired texture is reached. Add salt, sugar, cayenne, heavy cream, and 3 tablespoons Kewpie-style mayonnaise. Stir to combine. Wrap and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 1 hour. Taste and adjust seasonings.</ol>
    <ol>4. Butter bread slices and use 1/2 of the egg salad on each sandwich. Cut crusts off before serving if you're fancy.</ol>
